### Additional Considerations:
    ☐ Plan for handling a support-ticket flood upon release
    ☐ Evaluate support-team metrics & SLAs
    ☐ Assess need for a dedicated data team or expanded permissions
    ☐ Coordinate with backend, app dev, and Ruptella
    ☐ Restrict CS agents (except eng & management) from accessing location data
    ☐ Explore support payloads to limit CS access to location data

### Future Enhancements:
    ☐ Implement auto-detection of stale data
    ☐ Introduce intelligent correction suggestions
    ☐ Allow users to push a button to collect & send device logs to DIMO
    ☐ Add a title bar for DIMO Validation
    ☐ Generate friendly names based on car type (ICE/EV)
