    ☐ Move accurate/inaccurate/outdated/skip to bottom
    ☐ Remove redundant speed indicators
    ☐ Add disclaimer: “Data submitted through this app won’t reflect in mobile app”

### LIWD (Login & Vehicle Data) Fixes:

    ☐ Fix Login Issue: Ensure login does not fail when not all vehicles are shared
    ☐ Resolve Client-Side Errors: Fix issue when canceling LIWD flow
    ☐ Add Missing Logout Button for users

### FAQ Section (v0/v1):

    ☐ Add FAQ Section covering:
        • What is the goal of this app?
        • How will user data be validated?
        • How long does a vehicle need to be shared?

### Landing Page Updates:

    ☐ Clearly highlight the app’s purpose
    ☐ Label LWID and Sharing on the landing page
    ☐ List supported browsers (crypto wallet browsers are not supported)

### Data Accuracy & Submission Enhancements:

    ☐ Clarify how users should compare and submit validation data
    ☐ Implement a guide on submitting valid data
    ☐ Address parked car data limitations
    ☐ Define a threshold for inaccuracy that requires validation ticket submission

### Data Storage & Analysis:

    ☐ Implement a database for analytics
    ☐ Determine whether a spreadsheet is sufficient for CS purposes

### Regional Settings & Units:

    ☐ Fix issue where system defaults to kilometers after switching to miles
    ☐ Create region-based selectors: US/North America, UK, EU, Canada

        • Combustion (ICE)
    ☐ Create checklist for supported fuel types:
        • Gasoline
        • Diesel
        • Electricity
        • Consider adding hydrogen

### Additional Considerations:

    ☐ Plan for handling support ticket flood upon release
    ☐ Evaluate support team metrics & SLAs impact
    ☐ Assess need for a dedicated data team or expanded permissions
    ☐ Coordinate with backend, app dev, and Ruptella for issue resolution
    ☐ Restrict CS agents (except eng & management) from accessing location data
    ☐ Explore support payloads to limit CS access to location data
