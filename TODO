    Add Missing Logout Button for users (Consult with SDK team to get this integrated)

### FAQ Section (v0/v1):

    ☐ Add FAQ Section covering:
        • What is the goal of this app?
        • How will user data be validated?
        • How long does a vehicle need to be shared?

### Landing Page Updates:

    ASSIGNED TO HARVEY

    ☐ Clearly highlight the app’s purpose
    ☐ Label LWID and Sharing on the landing page
    ☐ List supported browsers (crypto wallet browsers are not supported)

### Data Accuracy & Submission Enhancements:

    V1 Items

    ☐ Clarify how users should compare and submit validation data
    ☐ Implement a guide on submitting valid data
    ☐ Address parked car data limitations
    ☐ Define a threshold for inaccuracy that requires validation ticket submission

### Data Storage & Analysis:

    ☐ Implement a database for analytics
    ☐ Determine whether a spreadsheet is sufficient for CS purposes

### Regional Settings & Units:

    ☐ Fix issue where system defaults to kilometers after switching to miles
    ☐ Create region-based selectors: US/North America, UK, EU, Canada
    ☐ Alternative: Individual unit selection for each measurement type
    ☐ Consider future expansion to LATAM and other regions

### Vehicle Type Classifications:

    ☐ Add dropdown for powertrain types:
        • PHEV (Plug-in Hybrid)
        • HEV (Hybrid)
        • BEV (Battery Electric)
        • Combustion (ICE)
    ☐ Create checklist for supported fuel types:
        • Gasoline
        • Diesel
        • Electricity
        • Consider adding hydrogen

### Additional Considerations:

    ☐ Plan for handling support ticket flood upon release
    ☐ Evaluate support team metrics & SLAs impact
    ☐ Assess need for a dedicated data team or expanded permissions
    ☐ Coordinate with backend, app dev, and Ruptella for issue resolution
    ☐ Restrict CS agents (except eng & management) from accessing location data
    ☐ Explore support payloads to limit CS access to location data

### Future Enhancements:

    ☐ Implement auto-detection of stale data
    ☐ Introduce intelligent correction suggestions
    ☐ Allow users to push a button to collect and send device logs to DIMO
    ☐ Add title bar for DIMO Validation
    ☐ Process friendly names based on car type (ICE/EV)

### Bugs found through user testing:
    ☐ Vehicles unpaired from devices cannot fetch VIN, considering keeping the car so they can view past data, but let them know the info will be outdated.
    ☐ Switching from KM to MI in Basic View mode catches the data change, and shows it as a data indifference rather than raw data
    ☐ Exterior Temperature was found to be -14 Celsius (7 Fahrenheit) when car reports 2 Celsius (47 Fahrenheit)
    ☐ When user reshares vehicle, vehicle list does not update
